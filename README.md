# About me

Here are some ideas about me:

- I've worked on deep learning, computer vision and radar signal processing for more than one year to pursue my master's degree.

- I’m looking to collaborate on LLM, VLM, RAG and AGENTS projects to practice what I've learned.

❤️ Wish you have a nice day!
